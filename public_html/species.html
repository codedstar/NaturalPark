                Wildlife</p>

                <p>The Park has  very rich flora and fauna. Over 93 species of mammals, about 300 species of  birds, 9 amphibian, 33 reptilian and several insectivorous species, and 56  endemic butterfly species have been recorded, in particular:<br>

</p>

                <p>i)<strong>&nbsp;Species  of Conservation and Tourist Interest in Mole</strong><br>

                  Mole National Park has over 90 species of mammals. &nbsp;Elephant, buffalo,  kob, warthog, waterbuck, bushbuck, roan<img src="https://molenationalpark.org/images/explore/e7.jpg" class="Img_padding" width="250" height="250" align="right"> antelope, hartebeest, duikers, oribi,  patas monkey and green (vervet) monkey are the species commonly seen at Mole National  Park.&nbsp;Aerial surveys of the large mammals have been carried out between  1993 and 2006. Predators in the Park include spotted hyenas, leopards, caracal,  civets, genets, jackals and mongooses. Even though there are lions in the park,  their population and home range has declined, making their presence and  sighting rare.<br>

                  </p>

                <p>ii)<strong>&nbsp;Endangered  Species</strong><br>

                  The lions (<em>pantheraleo</em>) and elephants (<em>laxodonta  Africana</em>) found in Mole National Park are currently listed as vulnerable on  the IUCN red list of 2004. The spotted hyena, buffalo, oribi, roan antelope,  kob, duiker and reedbuck are listed as lower risk on the same publication.  These species require particular management to thrive.<br>

                  </p>

                <p>iii)<strong>&nbsp;Birds</strong><br>

                  Studies have been made of the avian life in Mole National Park, and a full  report can be consulted (Dowsett, 2005). Over 300 bird species have been  recorded, many of which are migratory birds heading to or from Northern Europe.  The Carmine bee-eater and Saddle-billed stork are particularly stunning, and  all will appreciate their beauty!<br>

                  Mole is  unique in its bird populations: all 37 recorded Guinea-Sudanian biome species  found in Ghana are here in the National Park. If you are a keen bird watcher,  Mole is a must! As well as the species mentioned earlier, you are almost  guaranteed sightings of martial eagles, the white-headed and palm-nut vultures,  herons, egrets, the Abyssinian roller, the violet turaco and the red-throated  bee-eater, to name a few.<br>

                  </p>

                <p>iv)&nbsp;<strong>Reptiles</strong><br>

                  There are 33 reptile species in the Park. The Nile crocodile, slender snouted  crocodile and dwarf crocodile can be seen in the rivers within the Park.<br>

                  </p>

                <p>v)&nbsp;<strong>Butterflies</strong><br>

                  More than 50 butterfly species have been spotted in Mole National Park,  including the <em>Anthenetalboti</em>, which is usually limited to East Africa. Mole  is the only part of West Africa where this species has been recorded.<br>

                  The total  butterfly fauna is probably about 120. Most are typical of the Guinea savannah  belt. Two species of <em>Euphaedra</em> were  found: the genus is mainly one of the understorey of true evergreen forest, but  the two species in question seem well established in dense woodland in the  park.<br>

                  The West  African savannah habitats are generally not species rich, and there is  virtually no endemism. True savannah butterflies constitute about 15% of the  total Ghana butterfly fauna of more than 900 species. The best season for  butterfly studies in Mole is between late May and early June.<br>

                  </p>

                <p>vi)&nbsp;<strong>Flora</strong> <br>

                  The dominant  vegetation of Mole National Park is open savanna woodland with grasses that can  reach 3 metres high during the rainy season. Burning plays an integral part in  the maintenance of this vegetation. Bovals are open areas of short grassland  which are found on areas with shallow soils and iron pans. Narrow bands of  riverine forest grow along most of the streams. Other plant communities, such  as swamps and flood-plain grasslands, cover only small areas. Most of the 742  plant species found in Mole are widespread throughout the savanna zone.  However, the species of conservation value (4 endemic, 12 disjunct and 24  species which are rare or have a very limited distribution) is relatively high.  Their abundance is generally low and they  are often confined to small areas.<br>

                  Since 1916,  plants have been collected from within the present area of Mole National Park,  with the bulk of the collection carried out during the Aberdeen University  Expeditions and J. B. Hall's studies (Hall, 1976c). Hall published a  provisional check-list (Hall, 1976c) containing 719 species and subspecies. An  extended list including the authors' samplings (November/December 1992 and  February/March 1993) has been compiled by Schmitt and Adu-Nsiah, 1993. It  contains 739 species of vascular plants which include 148 tree, 61 shrub, 166  grass and 281 herb species, 75 climbers and 8 ferns.<br>

                <p><strong>Species of Conservation Value at  Mole National Park2</strong><br>

                  Local  endemism is generally low in West African savannah, and only two endemic  species are confined to northern Ghana: <em>Kyllingaechinata</em>,  a sedge, and <em>Aneilemasetiferum</em> var. <em>pallidiciliatum</em> are found in Mole. In  addition, three species which are endemic to Ghana were recorded, namely <em>Gongronemaobscurum</em>, <em>Raphionacmevignei</em> and <em>Rhinopterysangustifolia</em>.<br>

                  The 11  disjunct species of Mole are confined to savannah woodland, with the exception  of&nbsp;<em>Mimusops kummel,&nbsp;</em>a tree found in riverine forests.  Five species have been identified in Mole which have not been recorded  elsewhere in Ghana:&nbsp;<em>Croton pseudopulchellus,  Indigoferaconferta, Indigoferatrichopoda, Jatrophaneriifolia&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Pleiotaxisnewtonii.</em> <br>

  <em>Anthocleistavogelii,&nbsp;</em>a tree of wet sites in the  south-western forest zone, was recorded for the first time in Mole.&nbsp;<em>Apodostigmapallens</em>&nbsp;is a climber which is normally also  restricted to the forests in the south-west.&nbsp;<em>Amblygonocarpusandogenesis</em>, a savannah tree widespread in  central, east and south tropical Africa, was recorded for the second time in  Ghana.<br>

                  Approximately  38% of the plants recorded in Mole are also found in the forest zone. 39% of  them (or 15% of all Mole plants) were classified as 'non forest species' by  Hawthorne and JuamMusah (1993). 461 or 62% of the plants found in Mole are  savannah species.</p>
